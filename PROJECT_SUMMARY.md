# VJudge Contest Ranking Crawler - Project Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Created

I've successfully created a complete Python application to extract VJudge contest ranking data with the following components:

### Core Files
1. **`vjudge_crawler.py`** - Main crawler class with Selenium WebDriver
2. **`vjudge_gui.py`** - User-friendly GUI interface using tkinter
3. **`crawl_cli.py`** - Command-line interface for automation
4. **`examples.py`** - Demonstration scripts and usage examples
5. **`test_crawler.py`** - Test suite to verify functionality
6. **`setup.py`** - Automated setup and installation script

### Supporting Files
7. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
8. **`requirements.txt`** - Python package dependencies
9. **`run_gui.bat`** - Windows batch file to easily launch GUI

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Data Extraction
- ✅ Extracts complete ranking data from VJudge contests
- ✅ Captures: Rank, Team Name, Score, Penalty, Individual Problem Results
- ✅ Handles multiple contest formats and layouts
- ✅ Supports batch processing of multiple contests

### User Interfaces
- ✅ **GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface with:
  - Contest ID input and management
  - Progress tracking and logging
  - Output directory selection
  - Headless mode option
  
- ✅ **Command Line Interface**: For automation and scripting
- ✅ **Programmatic API**: For integration with other Python scripts

### Data Export
- ✅ Exports to CSV format with proper headers
- ✅ Configurable output directory
- ✅ Handles special characters and Unicode team names
- ✅ Preserves problem attempt information (times, penalties)

### Technical Features
- ✅ Automatic Chrome driver management
- ✅ Headless browser support for faster execution
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Real-time progress updates
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## 📊 Data Structure

The extracted CSV files contain:
```
Rank | Team Name | Score | Penalty | Solved Problems | Problem A | Problem B | ...
1    | Team XYZ  | 10    | 1240    | 10             | 0:55:00   | 1:27:00   | ...
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: GUI (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
python vjudge_gui.py
```
Or double-click `run_gui.bat` on Windows

### Option 2: Command Line (For automation)
```bash
# Single contest
python crawl_cli.py 739901

# Multiple contests
python crawl_cli.py 739901 739902 739903 --headless

# Custom output directory
python crawl_cli.py 739901 --output my_results
```

### Option 3: Python Integration
```python
from vjudge_crawler import VJudgeRankingCrawler

with VJudgeRankingCrawler(headless=True) as crawler:
    data = crawler.get_contest_data("739901")
    csv_file = crawler.save_to_csv(data, "output")
```

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Automatic Setup** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

2. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ✅ Tested and Verified

- ✅ Python 3.13 compatibility
- ✅ Windows 11 compatibility  
- ✅ Chrome WebDriver auto-installation
- ✅ Package imports and dependencies
- ✅ Basic crawler functionality
- ✅ GUI interface launches successfully

## 🎮 Example Usage Scenarios

1. **Research**: Analyze contest performance across multiple competitions
2. **Statistics**: Track team rankings and problem-solving patterns  
3. **Automation**: Regularly download contest results for analysis
4. **Archival**: Backup contest data before it becomes unavailable

## 🔒 Compliance Notes

- Uses public contest data only
- Respects VJudge's terms of service
- Includes delays between requests to avoid overloading servers
- No authentication bypassing or private data access

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

The VJudge Contest Ranking Crawler is now fully functional and ready to use. You can:

1. **Start immediately** with the GUI: `python vjudge_gui.py`
2. **Test the installation**: `python test_crawler.py`  
3. **See examples**: `python examples.py`
4. **Read full docs**: Open `README.md`

The application will automatically handle Chrome driver installation, contest data extraction, and CSV generation. Just provide the contest IDs and you'll get clean, structured data ready for analysis!
